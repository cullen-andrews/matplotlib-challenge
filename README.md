Examining the Mouse Weight vs Tumor Volume, we see a fair, positive, linear correlation (r = 0.84).


For the graph of mouse m601's tumor volume vs time, we see a steady trend downward during the mouse's treatment with the drug Capomulin.

Comparing the boxplots of the final tumor volumes of mice in the drug regimens Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamine, we see that Ramicane and Capomulin treated mice have clearly lower final tumor volumes than those treated with Infubinol and Ceftamin. One mouse in the Infubinol group was a statistical outlier and exhibited a final tumor volume approximately equal to the median tumor volume for Capomulin and Ramicane.
